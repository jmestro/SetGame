# SetGame
Homework assignment #3 for CS193P.

It looks like I didn't seat the SetGame model in the correct folder. Darn.
I hate when I do that.

The official game rules are at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)

There are additional notes in SetGame.swift regarding the status of this work.
I'll return to refactoring after I catch-up on building other parts of the app.

Thanks to everyone for checking out the code and if you have a notion on what
would make the isValidSet method better, I am interested in learning about it.
I haven't thought about it much, but I currently don't see how to improve it.
